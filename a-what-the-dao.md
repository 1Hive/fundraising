# a\) What the DAO

Unless you have been living under a rock you might have heard of the term DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organization. 

Think of a company, a foundation, a cooperative, an activist group, the state itself, democracy and so on and so forth... These are all umbrella terms for describing how a group of people can collectively measure, decide upon and enforce a range of things \(the popular will, budgets, laws etc...\). 

So the DAO acronym at the highest level translates to: an ensemble of programmable logics to describe and enact the functioning of real world organizations in a digital manner. This is done by way of running self enforcing agreements/programs \(smart contracts\) on immutable ledgers \(blockchains\).

Decentralized stands for: power does not reside in the hands of one person and the DAO's behavior can be the aggregation of millions of agents \(human or machine\).

Autonomous means that as the blockchain on which these DAOs run \(usually Ethereum\) are themselves decentralized and censorship resistant the DAO cannot be shutdown. Another school of thought attributes the A in DAO to Automated: by using these self enforcing smart contracts once a logic is imputed, if the condition is verified then it automatically. For example a DAO that acts as a mutual insurance policy for farmers where if the average temperature in a region is verified to exceed 25Â° over a certain time period the farmers are paid. If the DAO can verify this information it will pay out farmers no matter what! This leads to a huge reduction of overhead costs in an economy by removing uncertainty over outcomes and 3rd party costs.

In a way DAOs allow groups of friends, colleagues, citizens etc. to organize themselves without the need for an army, judges, lawyers and banks to set up and enforce that organization.

If you are interested in knowing how a DAO functions technically and how permissions are a super powerful tool for building modular organizational architectures you can read  the Aragon documentation over here: [https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started).
