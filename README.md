# Preface and Resources

Aragon Fundraising is a suite of apps built on top of Aragon enabling DAO's to fundraise via a bonding curve mechanism.

Don't worry if these terms don't make sense to you right now and let's deconstruct in simple terms what this all means!

**1\) DAOs**

_If you already know about DAOs you can skip straight to part 2_

Unless you have been living under a rock you might have heard of the term DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organization. 

Think of a company, a foundation, a cooperative, an activist group, the state itself, democracy and so on and so forth... These are all umbrella terms for describing how a group of people can collectively measure, decide upon and enforce a range of things \(the popular will, budgets, laws etc...\). 

So the DAO acronym at the highest level translates to: an ensemble of programmable logics to describe and enact the functioning of real world organizations in a digital manner. This is done by way of running self enforcing agreements/programs \(smart contracts\) on immutable ledgers \(blockchains\).

Decentralized stands for: power does not reside in the hands of one person and the DAO's behavior can be the aggregation of millions of agents \(human or machine\).

Autonomous means that as the blockchain on which these DAOs run \(usually Ethereum\) are themselves decentralized and censorship resistant the DAO cannot be shutdown. Another school of thought attributes the A in DAO to Automated: by using these self enforcing smart contracts once a logic is imputed, if the condition is verified then it automatically. For example a DAO that acts as a mutual insurance policy for farmers where if the average temperature in a region is verified to exceed 25Â° over a certain time period the farmers are paid. If the DAO can verify this information it will pay out farmers no matter what! This leads to a huge reduction of overhead costs in an economy by removing uncertainty over outcomes and 3rd party costs.

In a way DAOs allow groups of friends, colleagues, citizens etc. to organize themselves without the need for an army, judges, lawyers and banks to set up and enforce that organization.

If you are interested in knowing how a DAO functions technically and how permissions are a super powerful tool for building modular organizational architectures you can read  the Aragon documentation over here: [https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started).

You can also check examples of real world DAO use cases here: 

**2\) Fundraising for DAOs** 

Until today DAO protocols/platforms were capable of a variety of things: vote to enact an action or survey the opinion of a group, hold and send funds, mechanisms to allocate these funds and attribute these funds \(majority one person one vote, dot voting, quadratic voting, holographic consensus,  etc...\) and more that you can check on testing Aragon.

However DAOs had no straight-forward way of having capital enter and exit in a liquid fashion. They would either .....\(tbd\)

**3\) Bonding Curves** 

The following resources are a recommended to get a cursory overview of the concepts of bonding curves, DAOs, DAICOS and the philosophy of our implementation which will be the subject of this documentation.
