# c\) Intro to bonding curves



When we think about exchanging shares in a company, real estate property, cooperative, membership in a club there were until two ways of doing it: over the counter \(OTC\) or via an exchange. In OTC a buyer and a seller negociate a price \(or are put in contact through a 3rd party\) and then enter into a transaction: this is very slow and costly process that hugely reduces the liquidity of the asset. Selling a house can for example take months or years. On the other side there are order book based exchanges such as the stock market: these work for high volume assets where there are  lots of buyers and sellers such as commodities. An order book exchange matches buyer and sellers when both specify a similar price range and settles an order at their behalf.

Token bonding curves are a novel crypto-economic pricing mechanism that constitutes a new . At their core they are smart contracts that acts as an automated market maker: the bonding curve contract emits an organization token at a price that is algorithmically determined by the smart contract according to a formula specified at it's deployment and in function of variables such as token supply.
