# Pre-sale

Fundraising allows for projects to fund a pre-sale as a way to:

a\) Guarantee a minimum reserve and tap amount

b\) Level the playing field between stakers 

c\) Offer transparency and equal opportunity for fundraising campaigns

d\) Automate curve initialisation by testing campaign metrics against minimum terms

The pre-sale screens enables an individual/DAO to configure it's pre-sale terms, launch and communicate around it.
