# Providing accountability - Tap

The tap is the rate of how many tokens of collateral can be withdrawn per time period by project managers to sustain.

The tap is defined in the smart contracts by "the number of tokens per second which can be withdrawn from the reserve". 

In the Fundraising app the default measure is in tokens of collateral per month in absolute value. This measure can be updated by a certain % every period \(by default 10% per month\). This updating mechanism is restricted to x % per month.

The beneficiary of the tap can be updated via a request by any user that is authorised by the permission system \(such as a BOARD or SHARE token holder\). This would trigger a vote by SHARE token holders.
