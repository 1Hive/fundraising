The Overview tab provides essential information about the bonding curve:  


* **“Price”** is the current price for the fundraising token in USD and is accompanied under it by the price increase in the most recent period in both units and percentage.
* **“Market Cap”** is the current price multiplied by the current token supply and is shown in USD with underneath the increase in the most recent period in both units and percentage.
* **“Trading Volume”** reflects the USD amount of trading of the fundraising token in the latest period along with the increase compared to the previous period in both units and percentage.
* **“Token Supply”** displays the currently issued supply of tokens by the bonding curve contract along with the increase compared to the previous period in both units and percentage.
* **“Reserves”** displays the collateral balance in reserve…..
* **"Monthly Allowance"** shows the amount of funds to be allocated to the underlying project every month along with the yearly allowance underneath.

The curve graphic displays the curve of the bonding curve plotted using the token supply on the horizontal axis and corresponding price on the vertical axis.

The curve behaviour can be explored by hovering over any point of the curve which then displays an information box with the token supply and corresponding price. One point corresponds to current token supply and price while another point corresponds to the coordinates being hovered over.
