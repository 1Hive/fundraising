# Placing an order

**\(UPDATE W SCREENS\)**

By clicking the cross-tab “New Order” button a side panel appears with options to place buy and sell orders. 

Price is given for each collateral type, which can be toggled between by clicking the token symbol icon. An estimation of price for that batch is given with a maximum slippage rate applied \(by default 20%\) where the batched order is not filled if the difference between the order price and the execution price exceed this limit.

To switch between buying orders and selling orders toggle between "Buy" and "Sell" screens.
