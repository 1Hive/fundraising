# b\) How can DAOs raise funds

Until today DAO protocols/platforms were capable of a variety of things: vote to enact an action or survey the opinion of a group, hold and send funds, mechanisms to allocate these funds and attribute these funds \(majority one person one vote, dot voting, quadratic voting, holographic consensus,  etc...\) etc.. There are many more possibilities and you can browse some of them by testing Aragon at: [https://mainnet.aragon.org/](https://mainnet.aragon.org/).

However DAOs had no straight-forward way of having capital enter and exit in a liquid fashion. Until now people could send funds to a DAO's treasury address as a grant, or alternatively purchase shares with a limited number of exit events \(such as in Moloch's rage quit\).

The solution adopted by Aragon Fundraising is called a DAICO \(Decentralized Autonomous ICO\) or Continuous Organization where a project/organization structures itself as a DAO and then emits a token throughout what is called a continuous fundraising campaign. 

In a continuous fundraising campaign patrons purchase share tokens for a certain amount of collateral \(such as DAI, ETH, ANT etc..\). This collateral is then put into a reserve pool. Every time period \(for example monthly\) a fraction of this reserve pool called hereafter the tap is sent to an address \(the beneficiary address, by default would be the BOARD token holders DAO treasury\). The tap can be changed by a certain amount every period by the patrons and the beneficiary address by a vote of the board members. 



The following page will be consecrated to the modality of emission and redemption of this token by the bonding curve but for now let's focus on the other properties of a Fundraising DAO.

The DAO is constituted of project managers with a BOARD token. They can vote with this token to organize themselves in a cooperative fashion: they can vote on budgets, priorities, payroll, grants etc... 



But any one of the DAO members can configure a presale campaign and propose it to a vote of the BOARD token members \(you can go to the How to section for a practical explainer\). This presale allows patrons to purchase SHARE tokens which then al
