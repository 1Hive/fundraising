# b\) How can DAOs raise funds

Until today DAO protocols/platforms were capable of a variety of things: vote to enact an action or survey the opinion of a group, hold and send funds, mechanisms to allocate these funds and attribute these funds \(majority one person one vote, dot voting, quadratic voting, holographic consensus,  etc...\) etc.. There are many more possibilities and you can browse some of them by testing Aragon at: [https://mainnet.aragon.org/](https://mainnet.aragon.org/).

However DAOs had no straight-forward way of having capital enter and exit in a liquid fashion. Until now people could send funds to a DAO's treasury address as a grant, or alternatively purchase shares with a limited number of exit events \(such as in Moloch's rage quit\).

The solution adopted by Aragon Fundraising is called a DAICO \(Decentralized Autonomous ICO\) or Continuous Organization where a project/organization structures itself as a DAO and then emits a token throughout what is called a continuous fundraising campaign. 

A Fundraising DAO is characterised by its transparency, accountability and liquidity.

In a continuous fundraising campaign patrons purchase a DAO's tokens against a certain amount of collateral \(such as DAI, ETH, ANT etc..\). This collateral is then put into a reserve pool. 

Every time period \(for example monthly\) a fraction of this reserve pool here-after named  "tap" is sent to an address. The tap can be changed by a certain amount every period by the patrons and the beneficiary address by a vote of DAOs members.

Compared to traditional equity or token based fundraising methods there is no lump sum given to founders of a project, instead the amount available for expenses fluctuates over time. Terms of investment are transparent and equal for all participants. Project revenue can be sent to the reserve pool, increasing the value of the token and thus attracting patrons that wish to benefit from subsequent price increases.

The following page will be consecrated to the modality of emission and redemption of this token by the bonding curve and it's valuation.
